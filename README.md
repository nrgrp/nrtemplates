# NRTemplates

This repository contains some useful templates for various documents shared across the group.

## Article

* [zharticle](./article/zharticle): A LaTeX template for papers. Check [this repository](https://github.com/haozhu10015/latex-template) for potential updates.
* [zhbook](./article/zhbook): A LaTeX template for books, reports, notes, thesis, etc. There are lots of redundant sections in the template such that it can be adapted for different purposes; feel free to delete any of them if not needed. Check [this repository](https://github.com/haozhu10015/latex-template) for potential updates.

## Presentation

* [zhslides](./presentation/zhslides): A LaTeX (Beamer) template for slides, close to the style provided by the package [FoilTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/foiltex). (A slides template using FoilTeX instead of Beamer can be found [here](https://github.com/haozhu10015/latex-template/tree/main/slides/foiltex).) Check [this repository](https://github.com/haozhu10015/latex-template) for potential updates.

## Poster
